# Mini Project - Text Similarity
- Jonas Hein - https://github.com/Zenzus

This project illustrates multiplication of vectors and the use of cosine similarity method for estimation the correlation between vectors.

Store some text in three files:

• two of the files, let's call them A and B, contain texts, created by the same author X

• the third text - C - is created by another author - Y.

Create a program to convert the texts into vectors, to compare the vectors in pairs::

• A and B

• A and C

• B and C

and to suggest the authors of each text based on the calculated similarity coefficients..
